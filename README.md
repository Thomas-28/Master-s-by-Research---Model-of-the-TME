# Tumor Microenvironment Modeling: Code Repository

This repository contains the code used to generate most of the figures in my Master's thesis titled "Modelling the Tumour Microenvironment and Reversible and Irreversible Chemotherapy Resistance." For the sake of clarity and focus some of the code for the more straightforward to reproduce figures has been ommitted.

The repository simply consists of a series of files titled "Figure X," where X is corresponding figure number in my thesis which that file's code produces. Additionally, there are two .csv data files which contain the output of a Mathematica script that was used to generate Figure 27.

## Core Requirements 
Python version 3.8.3
Jupyter Notebook version 6.0.3
Numpy version 1.18.5
Matplotlib version 3.2.2
