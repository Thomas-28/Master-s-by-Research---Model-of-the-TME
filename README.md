# Tumor Microenvironment Modeling: Code Repository

This repository contains the code used to generate most of the figures in my Master's thesis titled "Modelling the Tumour Microenvironment and Reversible and Irreversible Chemotherapy Resistance." For the sake of clarity and focus, some of the code for the more straightforward figures has been omitted.

The repository consists of a series of files titled "Figure X," where X corresponds to the figure number in my thesis that the file's code produces. Additionally, there are two .csv data files that contain the output of a Mathematica script used to generate Figure 27.

## Core Requirements 
- Python version 3.8.3
- Jupyter Notebook version 6.0.3
- Numpy version 1.18.5
